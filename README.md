# Social-Networking-System
This is a java project for a Simplified Social Networking System. It is a simple social network like Facebook with an add on of Potential infections.

In this project after you run the main method, 2 groups will be created. One open group called WebGurus and a closed one called ExamSolutions.

MAIN PANEL:
Then the user interface appears("Main Panel"). There you allowed to Create a new user with a unique Username and a valid Email. After the user is created, in panel you can choose 
to either create a new user, login as the existing user, check and see the potential infections or save everything in a file. 

POTENTIAL INFECTIONS PANEL:
In the potential infection panel, you will see the name of the user that logged in at the top, and a list with all the names of their friends 
and also with the names of their friends friends as users that have to be tested.

If the logged in user has no friends, then an other message will be written.

USER PAGE:
In the user page panel, at the top is the name and the email of the logged in user
. 
Underneath that, is a text field in which the user can write the name of another user, and then click the "Become Friends" button to become 
friends with the other user.

There is also a list with the 2 groups mentioned above. If the user chooses the open group, then after clicking the "Enter Group" button
they will enroll in that group.

If the user chooses the closed group the there are only 2 ways to enroll:
1)To be the first user to try to enroll in the group
2)To have a friend that is already enrolled in the group

Underneath these, is a text area where the user can write a post and then upload it by clicking the "Post" button.

Underneath that is another text area, where all the post made by the user and their friends will be shown with the most recent/latest post 
to be at the top of the list.

Lastly, underneath that will be a text area with the names of the suggested friends which will be the users that are friends with the friends
of the logged in user. 

If every friend of the friends of the user is already a friend with the user, or if the user has no friends then 
the suggested friends text are will have a different message.

Every panel except the main one, has a back to login screen button that returns to the mail panel.
